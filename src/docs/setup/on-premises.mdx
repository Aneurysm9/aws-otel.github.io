## Install the AWS OTel Collector
1. Set up the required [AWS credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
2. Log in to the host and download AWS OTel Collector RPM with the following command.
```
wget https://aws-observability-collector-release.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon_linux/amd64/v0.1.11/aws-observability-collector-0.1.13.rpm
```
3. Install the AWS OTel Collector RPM by the following command on the host.
```
sudo rpm -Uvh ./aws-otel-collector.rpm
```
4. After RPM is installed, it will create  AWS OTel Collector in directory `/opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/` with the
following folder layout.

5. After  AWS OTel Collector is installed on the host, the following commands can be used to start, stop, and check the running status.
    a) Start  AWS OTel Collector with CTL script. The config.yaml is optional; if itâ€™s not provided, the default
    [config](https://github.com/mxiamxia/aws-opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/config.yaml) is applied.
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c </path/config.yaml> -a start
    ```
    b) Stop  AWS OTel Collector process
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -a stop
    ```
    c) Check the status of  AWS OTel Collector
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl  -a status
    ```
