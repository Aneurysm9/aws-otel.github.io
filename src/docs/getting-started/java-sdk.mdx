OpenTelemetry provides different language SDKs to instrument code for collecting telemetry data in the application.

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to use [OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java) for manual instrumentation on traces and metrics and utilize [AWS OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation Agent](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation) for traces auto instrumentation in the applications.

## Getting Started

* [Manual Instrumentation on Metrics with Java SDK](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/metric-manual-instr)
* [Auto Instrumentation on Traces with Auto Agent](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-auto-instr)
* [Manual Instrumentation on Traces with Java SDK](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-manual-instr)


## Sample Code with Java SDK
* [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Sample Code with Java SDK](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework/tree/terraform/sample-apps/spark)
* [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Playground in Traces Auto Instrumentation](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-playground)
