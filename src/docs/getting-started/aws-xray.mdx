To support [OpenTelemetry Traces](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/trace/api.md)
 in [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/), we have discussed how to use OpenTelemetry SDKs and [Auto Instrumentation Agent](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation)
 to create distributed traces for applications. AWS X-Ray has also worked OpenTelemetry communities to provide [AWS X-Ray collector exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter)
 which can convert OpenTelemetry traces to AWS X-Ray format data and display it on AWS X-Ray console.

 In this tutorial, we will discuss how to config [AWS OTel Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) to send OpenTelemetry Metrics data to AWS X-Ray

## Getting Started

To get started using AWS OTel Collector to send distributed traces, you first install AWS OTel Collector in your
computing environment for collecting the telemetry data from various of applications.

For more information about installing AWS OTel Collector for each of the AWS platforms, see the getting started section for
* <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs">ECS</Link>
* <Link to="/docs/setup/ec2">EC2</Link>
* <Link to="/docs/setup/eks">EKS</Link>
* <Link to="/docs/setup/on-premises">On-Premises</Link>

We will discuss how to configure AWS OTel Collector for enabling AWS X-Ray.

By Default, AWS OTel Collector has enabled accepting OTLP Traces data and send it to AWS X-Ray backend with the default
configuration via [AWS XRay Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter).
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:55680
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:55681
processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 50
exporters:
  awsemf:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

You can learn more configuration options of AWS XRay Exporter for AWS OTel Collector at [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter).
And you can follow our AWS OTel Collector setup instructions to run the examples with the traces show up on AWS X-Ray Console.
There are more example demos in [Java SDK](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk) and [JavaScript SDK](/docs/getting-started/javascript-sdk) pages.
