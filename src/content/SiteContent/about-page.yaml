title: About AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
description:
  This page is about the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry including features and background information
path: /about

intro: AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project.

features:
  - item:
      Instrument your applications just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions and
      use auto-instrumentation agents to collect traces without changing your code.
  - item:
      Collect metadata from your AWS resources and managed services, so you can correlate application performance data
      with underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.
  - item:
      Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to observe your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2),
      Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS Fargate,
      as well as on-premises.

blurb:
  OpenTelemetry is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project which defines an open specification that is
  implemented as open source APIs, libraries in multiple programming languages and agents to collect distributed traces
  and metrics for application monitoring.
